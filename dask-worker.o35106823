	

	 Welcome to the DLS compute cluster

	 For MPI jobs, please use 'module load openmpi'.

	 If using a different OpenMPI installation,
	 or manually specifying path to OpenMPI, option
	 '-mca orte_forward_job_control 1'
	 must be added to mpirun to ensure cluster functionality.

	 To use a GPU node, the consumable 'gpu' must be requested,
	 including the number of GPUs required (e.g. 'qrsh -l gpu=2').

	 Grid Engine documentation (e.g. User Guide) can be found in
	 /dls_sw/cluster/docs and on Confluence.

	 Please report any issues to linux.manager@diamond.ac.uk

/dls/science/groups/i04-1/conor_dev/ccp4/base/lib/python2.7/contextlib.py:24: UserWarning: Creating scratch directories is taking a surprisingly long time. This is often due to running workers on a network file system. Consider specifying a local-directory to point workers to write scratch data to a local disk.
